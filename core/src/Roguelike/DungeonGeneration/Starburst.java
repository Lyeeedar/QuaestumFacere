	 * Accept values for y and x (considered as the endpoints of lines) between
	 * 0 and 40, and return an angle in degrees (divided by two).  -LM-
	 *
	 * This table's input and output need some processing:
	 *
	 * Because this table gives degrees for a whole circle, up to radius 20, its
	 * origin is at (x,y) = (20, 20).  Therefore, the input code needs to find
	 * the origin grid (where the lines being compared come from), and then map
	 * it to table grid 20,20.  Do not, however, actually try to compare the
	 * angle of a line that begins and ends at the origin with any other line -
	 * it is impossible mathematically, and the table will return the value "255".
	 *
	 * The output of this table also needs to be massaged, in order to avoid the
	 * discontinuity at 0/180 degrees.  This can be done by:
	 *   rotate = 90 - first value
	 *   this rotates the first input to the 90 degree line)
	 *   tmp = ABS(second value + rotate) % 180
	 *   diff = ABS(90 - tmp) = the angular difference (divided by two) between
	 *   the first and second values.
	 *
	 * Note that grids diagonal to the origin have unique angles.

	/*
	 * Mark a starburst shape in the dungeon with the CAVE_TEMP flag, given the
	 * coordinates of a section of the dungeon in "box" format. -LM-, -DG-
	 *
	 * Starburst are made in three steps:
	 * 1: Choose a box size-dependant number of arcs.  Large starburts need to
	 *    look less granular and alter their shape more often, so they need
	 *    more arcs.
	 * 2: For each of the arcs, calculate the portion of the full circle it
	 *    includes, and its maximum effect range (how far in that direction
	 *    we can change features in).  This depends on starburst size, shape, and
	 *    the maximum effect range of the previous arc.
	 * 3: Use the table "get_angle_to_grid" to supply angles to each grid in
	 *    the room.  If the distance to that grid is not greater than the
	 *    maximum effect range that applies at that angle, change the feature
	 *    if appropriate (this depends on feature type).
	 *
	 * Usage notes:
	 * - This function uses a table that cannot handle distances larger than
	 *   20, so it calculates a distance conversion factor for larger starbursts.
	 * - This function is not good at handling starbursts much longer along one axis
	 *   than the other.
	 * This function doesn't mark any grid in the perimeter of the given box.
