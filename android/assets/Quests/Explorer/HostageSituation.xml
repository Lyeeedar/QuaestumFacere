        <SavedNoble>

            <Message>You escort the noble back to the client, the portly man quickly pulling the lady away as if you are about to dirty her with your filthy hands. With a haughty look he waves an aid over to pay you. As you turn to leave you look up to see the noble woman turn back to you and give you a grateful smile.</Message>
